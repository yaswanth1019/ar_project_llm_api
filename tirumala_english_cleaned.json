The temple of Venkateswara was built byThondamanking and reformed periodically by Cholas, Pandyas and Vijayanagar. The temple is constructed inSouth Indian architectureand is believed to be constructed over a period of time starting from 300 CE.TheGarbhagruha is called Ananda Nilayam.

The temple is one of the richest in the world in terms of donations received and wealth. There areseveral legendsassociated with the manifestation of the deity in Tirumala. According to one legend, the temple has amurtiof Venkateswara, it is believed, which shall remain there for the entire duration of the presentKali Yuga. As of 2023, it is one of the richest temples in world with a net worth of over 3lakhcrore.The total assets of the Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala, Tirupati, are estimated to be over 2.5lakhcrore in 2022.This includes land parcels, buildings, cash and gold deposits in banks, given as offerings to the temple by devotees.

DuringDvapara Yuga,Adishesharesided on earth asSeshachalam Hillsafter losing a contest withVayu. According toPuranas,Tirumalais regarded as Adivaraha Kshetra. After killingHiranyaksha,Adivaraharesided on this hill. Venkatachala Mahatyam is the widely accepted legend over Tirumala Temple. DuringKali Yuga,Naradaadvised some sages who were performingyagnato decide who could be given the fruits of yagna amongTrimurtis.Bhriguwas sent to test the Trinity. The sage who had an extra eye in the sole of his foot visitedBrahmaandShivaand went unnoticed in both these locations. He cursed Brahma to be not worshipped and Shiva to be worshipped as alingam. At last he visitedVishnuand the lord acts as if he had not noticed Bhrigu. Getting angered by this act, sage Bhrigu kicked Vishnu in the chest, to which Vishnu did not react and instead apologised to the Sage by massaging his feet. During this act, he squashed the extra eye that was present in the sole of Bhrigu's foot. HoweverLakshmifinds it as an insult since Vishnu's chest was considered as Lakshmi's residence  and Bhrigu kicked it which indirectly insulted Lakshmi. She then leftVaikunthaand came to Earth toKolhapurand started meditating. Vishnu bore human form asSrinivasa, left Vaikuntha, in search of Lakshmi, reached theSeshachalamhills in Tirumala and started meditating. Lakshmi learned of the condition of Srinivasa and called Shiva and Brahma. Shiva and Brahma then converted themselves into Cow and Calf and Lakshmi had handed over the cow and calf toCholaking ruling over Tirumala Hills at that time. The Cow would provide milk to Srinivasa daily while it was taken for grazing. One day, a cowherd saw this and tried to beat the Cow with his staff but Srinivasa had borne the injury. Getting angered by this Srinivasa had cursed the Chola king to become aDemonas dharma says sins committed by servants  should be borne by Kings. The king prayed for mercy after which Srinivasa said to him, that the King should take next birth as Akasharaja and should perform marriage of his daughter Padmavati with Srinivasa. Srinivasa went to his foster-motherVakula Devion Tirumala hills and stayed there for a while. After curse,Cholaking took rebirth as Akasharaja and he had a daughter named Padmavati, who was born in the Padmapushkarini situated at present dayTiruchanurinAndhra Pradesh. Srinivasa married Padmavati who is form of Lakshmi at present day Narayanavanam in Andhra Pradesh and returned to Tirumala Hills. The Lord's desire to be on the seven hills for the emancipation of mankind from the perpetual troubles ofKali Yuga. Both the Lord and Goddesses turn into stone deities expressing their wish to be always there. The temple finds a mention in theSangamepicSilappathikaram, Kovalan meeting a Brahmin asks him where he is from and why did he come here, and he Replied \"I came to satisfy my heart's desire, to see with my own eyes the glory ofVishnu, whom many worship with prayer as He reposes withLakshmiin His chest, on the couch of the thousand hooded Serpent, in the temple in island jutting out on the widening waves of the Kaveri, even as the blue clouds repose supine on the slopes of the lofty golden mountain .\" This line mentionsSrirangamand next he mentionsTirumalaas follows, \"I also came to see the beauty of the red-eyed Lord, holding in His beautiful lotus-hands the discus which is death to His enemies, and also the milk white conch  wearing a garland of tender flowers on His chest, and draped in golden flowers and dwelling on the topmost crest of the tall and lofty hill named Venkatam with innumerable waterfalls, standing like a cloud in its natural hue, adorned with a rainbow and attired with lightning, in the midst of a place both sides of which are illumined by the spreading rays of the sun and the moon.

The cost and availability of the tickets may vary, and they can be booked online or at designated TTD counters. Many devotees have their head tonsured as \"Mokku\", an offering to God. The daily amount of hair collected is over a ton. The hair is collected and is sold internationally creating a substantial profit for the temple.As per legend, when Venkateswara was hit on his head by a cowherd, a small portion of his scalp became bald. This was noticed by Neela Devi, aGandharvaprincess. Immediately, she cut a portion of her hair and, with her magic, implanted it on his scalp.Venkateswara noticed her sacrifice. As hair is a beautiful asset of the female form, he promised her that all his devotees who come to his abode would offer their hair to him, and she would be the recipient of all the hair received. Hence, it is believed that hair offered by the devotees is accepted by Neela Devi. The hill, Neeladri, one of the seven hills, is named after her.Traditionally the barbers employed to do the tonsuring were male and from theNayee casteand this caused some discrimination and failed to resolve the requests from women that they would like a female barber.A protest led byKagganapalli Radha Devioverturned the objections and temple agreed to appoint women barbers. Devi was recognised by Andhra Pradesh in 2017 and with an award of theNari Shakti Puraskarby the President of India in 2019. As per legend, it is believed that Srinivasa had to make arrangements for his wedding.Kuberacredited money to Venkateswara  for his marriage with Padmavathi. Srinivasa sought a loan of one crore and 1.14 crore  coins of gold from Kubera and hadVishvakarma, the divine architect, create heavenly surroundings in the Seshadri hills. Together, Srinivasa and Padmavathi lived for all eternity while Goddess Lakshmi, understanding the commitments of Vishnu, chose to live in his heart forever.In remembrance of this, devotees go to Tirupati to donate money in Venkateswara's hundi  so that he can pay it back to Kubera. The hundi collections go as high as  22.5 million a day. In the Thulabaram ritual, a devotee sits on a pan of aweighing balanceand the other pan is filled with materials greater than the weight of the devotee. Devotees usually offer sugar, jaggery, tulsi leaves, banana, gold, coins. This is mostly performed with newborn babies or children.

Museum is now planning to show interesting programs, documentaries, films on Tirumala and heritage everyday from 10 am to 6 pm. After or before the darshan of lord Venkateswara spend some time in the S V Museum and get enlightened with the hoary past and colorful present. The temple is the most significant monument of Indian art and architecture, which sums up and represents subtle values of Indian culture. The elaborations of the temple structures followed from establishment of image worship and accompanying development of the rituals took time to crystallize. From the early times, Hindu temples came into being under the royal patronage of great emperors of South and North. Later, the spirit was caught up by mercantile corporations and artisan guilds, resulting in constructing a chain of temples, great and small. Temples became very hub of rural and urban life in all aspects. Temple was the centre for religious, cultural, social, economic and educational activities and thus it became repository of all that was the best in fabric, architecture, sculpture and other arts. S.V.Museum on Temple Art in Tirupati is the first attempt at gathering traditions in Hindu art and architecture under one roof and presenting it to the visitors. Kacheri Nammalwar temple was a Ramanujakutam, in the north Mada street of Govindaraja Swamy temple in Tirupati, where two thousand Srivaishnavas were fed every day. This holy place is converted into Museum of Temple Art by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in 1983. The museum is divided into two sections A and B. Section A deals with temple architecture, from choosing a place for building a temple to ways of erecting a temple. The temple is the replica of cosmic man and the architecture, iconography, rituals and worship in a temple help us understand the limitations of human mind and see the aspects of Cosmic Consciousness, of which human being is a repository. The Nagara, Vesara and Dravida and umpteen styles in designing pillars, prakaras, steps etc are shown in this section with miniature models. The iconometry, the science and technology of measurements of icons and temple structures elaborate on the technicalities of designing an icon and temple structure. The stone gallery contains more than 80 wonderful images retrieved from across the region dating from 8th century AD to 19th century AD. Most of these stone sculptures speak of history of Vaishnavism in the region. The gallery of musical instruments has collected a wide range of instruments of bygone ages. Alaya vastu is the way a Hindu temple is planned and executed. This museum will take you through the technicalities of building a temple respecting all the practices accepted by agamas. Stapati is a person who supervises the building of a temple. Takshaka and Vardhaki are assistants to Stapati. Ornaments that decorate the icon are multitude in number. Yet, they are depicted here. Your visit to the museum would be a memorable one. Section B deals with Srivari Vahanams, vehicles of Vishnu, used during Brahmotsavams, wood carvings, one hundred and eight Divyakshetras or holy places for Vaishnavites, Mudras of Bharatanatya, traditional dance form of India, musical instruments, Kalamkari and other art expressions. In the rituals section, an attempt has been made to bring out the significance of ritualistic obligations known as Samskaras and comparison of Tirumala temple with Vedic altar. An interesting collection of vessels used in Agama is displayed. The museum is located near the Govindarajaswamy temple and very close to Tirupati Railway Station. The guide lecturers and gallery attendants of the museum will be happy to guide you through the galleries.

Museum TTD ManagementAdministrationTTD Trust BoardBoard ResolutionsTTD Administrative Sanction Photo GalleryPast - PresentUnique PhotosNews AlbumSrinivasa Kalyanam General InformationDo's and Don'tsFAQsDress CodeContact US Before the commencement of Brahmotsavam, the temple of Lord Sri Venkateswara is cleaned according to the guidelines given in the religious texts. The temple premises and its surroundings are decorated with flowers and mango leaves. This process is called Aalaya Suddhi and Alankaram . Mritsangrahanam  is carried out on the day prior to the first day of Brahmotsavam. The temple officials pray to deities like Vishvaksena, Anantha, Sudarshana and Garuda. They also pray to Mother Earth and collect a small quantity of earth, with which the Ankurarpanam ritual is conducted, by which the earth is spread in a room and nine kinds of cereals are sown in it. Dwajarohanam  signals the start of the Brahmotsavam. It is carried out at the Dwajasthambham, near the Nadimi Padi Kavili inside the temple complex. The temple officials hoist the flag  to the chanting of Vedic mantras by the temple priests. It is believed that Garuda goes to Devalokam to invite Gods like Brahma, Indra, Yama, Agni, Kubera and Vayudeva and sages like Vasistha and Vishwamitra. The Lord is taken in a procession around the streets of Tirumala on different vahanas . Each vahana has its own significance, and conveys the Lord s message in its own way. During Brahmotsavam, the Lord holds court in the main temple, after being taken around in a procession. The temple priests perform Naivedyam during this time. Snapanam  is the process of bathing the Lord with herbal water after the procession. It is believed to relieve the strain the Lord has undergone during the procession. Choornabhishekam involves bathing the lord and his consorts after anointing them with sandalwood powder. This is done on the morning of the ninth day of the Brahmotsavam. The Lord is then taken in a procession around the streets of Tirumala. The temple priests distribute the sandalwood powder used for the Lord to devotees. It is believed that the sandalwood powder has the power of clearing obstacles from one's path. The Chakrasnanam ritual is akin to the bathing ritual after the performance of a yagna. On the morning of the last day of Brahmotsavam, the Lord, his consorts and Sri Sudarshanachakram are bathed in the Swami Pushkarini. Devotees can also bathe in the Swami Pushkarini, along with Sri Sudarshanachakram. It is considered to be a very sacred ritual, and devotees participate in this ritual, irrespective of religion, caste or creed. On the last day of Brahmotsavam, the ritual of seeing off the rishis and Gods to Devalokam is called Devatodwasanam. It is performed after the daily archana. Lord Brahma is praised for organising the utsavam, and He is honoured by the temple priests and officials. Dwajavarohanam or lowering the flag  is carried out on the evening of the last day of Brahmotsavam. On the first day, Dhwajarohana is conducted by hoisting the Garudadhwaja , near the Srivari Alaya Dhwajasthambham. A spectacular procession of Lord Venkateswara on the Pedda Seshavahana is taken around the four streets of the main temple from 22:00 hrs till midnight. The meaning of Sesha is \"to serve\". Adi Sesha is a thousand-headed serpent, on whom Lord Sri Maha Vishnu rests in his abode, Vaikuntam. Tirumala Hills, the abode of Lord Sri Venkateswara, is believed to be the manifestation of Adisesha. In commemoration of this event, the Lord is carried in a procession around the streets of Tirumala on the Seshavahana  during the first two days of Brahmotsavam . On the second day, the Lord is taken around the streets of the temple on the Chinna Seshavahana in the morning. In the night, the deities are taken to the Uyala Mandapam for the Unjal Seva. They are then taken around the streets of Tirumala on the Hamsavahana. Hamsa or swan means 'pure'. Hamsa is believed to have a high intellectual capability, and can distinguish the good from the bad. In addition, Hamsa is visually appearing. It is for these reasons that Lord Brahma uses Hamsa not only as his vehicle, but also to chant the Vedas . On the morning of the third day, the deities are carried on the Simhavahana. Simha  is a symbol of regality and power. According to the Bhagvad Gita, the Lord is the Simha among animals . The Lord is also called Hari  and Hari sits on Simha. In other words, we have the phenomenon of the Lord sitting on himself. It is also believed that the Lord assumed the form of Narasimha  to kill the demon Hiranyakasipu. Therefore, Lord Venkateswara uses the Simha as his vehicle on the third day of Brahmotsavam. In the night, Unjal Seva is conducted. The deities then ride in the Mutayalapandiri Vahana, which is decorated with a pearl canopy. Mutyam  is a symbol of purity and royalty. On the fourth day, the deities are carried in a Kalpavriksha Vahana in the morning. Kalpavriksham is a tree that is believed to grant boons and fulfil devotees wishes. The vehicle shaped like the Kalpavriksham signifies that the Lord grants boons and fulfils the wishes of his devotees. In the night, after the Unjal Seva, the deities are carried in a Sarvabhoopala Vahana. Sarvabhoopala means 'all the kings of Mother Earth'. According to the Hindu religion, kings, like Lord Vishnu, should always protect their people . To thank Lord Vishnu for his ideals and pray to him, the kings take the form of the Sarvabhoopala Vahana on the fourth day of Brahmotsavam. On the fifth day, Mohini Avatarotsavam is celebrated to commemorate the Lord's incarnation as Mohini, in the morning. According to legend, the Devatas and the Demons performed Ksheerasagaramadhanam that resulted in amrit  and other sacred qualities. The Devatas and the Demons fought for possession of the Amrit. Lord Vishnu then assumed the form of Mohini  and procured the Amrit for the Devatas. The Lord is dressed like Mohini, and He is taken in a procession in a Pallaki . Lord Krishna is also taken in the same procession. This is to celebrate the assistance rendered by Lord Vishnu to the Devatas during Ksheerasagaramadhanam. After the Unjal Seva in the night, the Lord and his consorts are seated on Garuda Vahana. Lord is decorated with Mahaakanti, Sahasranaramala that day. According to the ancient Hindu texts, Garuda, the king of birds, is a replica of the Vedas , while Lord Vishnu is the God of the Vedas. Therefore, the Lord sees Himself in Garuda. In the Vaishnava Puranas, Garuda is also called periyatiruvadi, meaning the first devotee. Therefore, Lord Venkateswara selected Garuda as his vehicle for the most important day of the Brahmotsavam. Garuda Vahana is the greatest of all the Vahanas. A large number of pilgrims visit the temple on this day. On the morning of the sixth day, the deities are carried on a beautifully-decorated Hanumad Vahana. Hanuman was one of the greatest devotees of Sri Rama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Hanuman served the Lord so faithfully, that even the Lord could not thank Hanuman enough. Devotees believe that they are indeed blessed if they catch a glimpse of the Lord on Hanumad Vahanam. Unjal Seva is not performed on the sixth day. Instead, Vasantotsavam  is celebrated. In the night, the Lord is mounted on the Gaja Vahana. Gajam  is also called the samajam . It symbolises wealth . It also symbolises the Airavatam   the vehicle of Devendra, the head of the heavens in Hindu mythology. It also can be attributed to the elephant in Gajendramoksham , which is saved from a crocodile by Lord Vishnu. To thank Lord Vishnu for his ideals and pray to him, the kings take the form of the Sarvabhoopala Vahana on the fourth day of Brahmotsavam. Therefore, the Lord is taken in a procession seated on a Gaja Vahana during Brahmotsavam. On the morning of the seventh day, the Lord rides on Suryaprabha Vahana . Surya , the son of Aditi, is another form of Lord Vishnu . Hindu mythology supports the heliocentric theory, and believes that Lord Vishnu is the centre of the universe . To symbolise this, Lord Venkateswara uses the Suryaprabha  Vahana. After the Unjal Seva in the night, the Lord is taken in the Chandraprabha Vahana  around the brightly-lit streets of Tirumala. Chandra means the Moon, which is considered cool and pleasant. According to Hindu mythology, Chandra is the commander of the mind . He is also the king of aushadha . It is believed that riding in the Chandraprabha Vahana is a soothing experience for the Lord. The Lord's contentment will bring peace to devotees' minds and result in a good crop. On the penultimate day, Rathotsavam is celebrated, in which the Lord is seated in a ratham  and taken in a procession in the morning. It is believed that those who witness Rathotsavam will not be reborn . The idols of Daruka  and the four horses  are placed before the decorated idols of the Lord and his consorts. This symbolises that the lord s charioteer is driving the chariot. In the night, the Lord is mounted on the Gaja Vahana.Gajam  is also called the samajam . It symbolises wealth . It also symbolises the Airavatam   the vehicle of Devendra, the head of the heavens in Hindu mythology. It also can be attributed to the elephant in Gajendramoksham , which is saved from a crocodile by Lord Vishnu. The chariot is pulled along by devotees, who chant Govinda!, Govinda! This is the only opportunity that devotees get to be of service to the Lord during Brahmotsavam. After the Unjal Seva in the night, the deities are taken in the Aswa  Vahana. Horses formed one of the four wings  of the military forces in ancient times. Aswam, a symbol of energy, means 'one who runs fast'. Lord Venkateswara travels on a horse when he goes for paruveta. According to Hindu mythology, the horse was born along with Sri Mahalakshmi, Airavatham and Amritam during Sheerasagaramadhanam. On the last day, Pallaki Seva and Chakrasnana Mahotsavam in the morning and Dhwajavarohanam are performed in the evening. The processional images are anointed with oil, turmeric powder and other auspicious ingredients and Abhishekam is performed. Sudarsan Chakram is given a bath in the Swami Pushkarini. The Garuda flag is then lowered. SriVenkateshwara Recording Project Hindu Dharma Parirakshana Samithi"
